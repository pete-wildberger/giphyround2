#Giphy API Search using Angular.js#

Building off of a previous [activity] (https://github.com/pete-wildberger/Giphy-API-activity) I created a new app for searching Giphy's API to get gifs.  This activity improves upon the last one (which used JQuery and AJAX) by adding a 'get a random gif' search button.  When you type in a query into the search bar you will receive the top 25 gifs related to your query. There is also a delete button to delete gifs you don't like.
